## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", destfile = "activity.zip")
data <- read.table(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), header=TRUE, sep = ",", colClasses = c("numeric", "factor", "numeric"))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
data_per_day <- data %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(steps_per_day = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(data_per_day, aes(steps_per_day)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
mean_steps <- mean(data_per_day$steps_per_day)
median_steps <- median(data_per_day$steps_per_day)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
avg_steps_per_interval <- data %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(mean_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(avg_steps_per_interval, aes(x = interval, y = mean_steps)) +    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("Average Number of Steps taken")
avg_steps_per_interval$interval[which.max(avg_steps_per_interval$mean_steps)]
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
